This is my attempt at the Ruby Quiz for creating a 20 questions game. I haven't read the answers yet (and I know there must be much more elegant ways to do this), but I thought it would be good practice. I'm also just starting to learn about SQL, so it would be awesome to go back and refactor this with databases to use the best questions to ask to narrow down the answers in the best way possible.
